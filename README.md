# SKCAN-Compare

Tool to retrieve and visualize data contained in SCKAN (e.g., across species, relationship to spinal segments) to highlight similarities and differences in neuronal pathways.

## Project Objective

The SPARC Connectivity Knowledge Base of the Autonomic Nervous System (SCKAN) is a semantic store modeling the topology of nerve-end organ connectivity and acts as a core component of powerful query and visualization capabilities within SPARC.

## features

  - Visualize neuronal pathways
    
  - Compare species
    
  - Phenotypic Relation :
    
          - Expresses a relation between a neuron population and its immediate effect on postsynaptic cells (Excitatory or Inhibitory);
    
          - Expresses a relation between a neuron population and its circuit role phenotype (Intrinsic, Motor, Sensory, or Projection);
    
          -  Expresses a relation between a neuron population and a brain region where the neuron population sends axons towards (Spinal cord descending projection, Spinal cord ascending projection);
    
          - Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a biological sex ( Male or Female from PATO)
    
## Benefits

Comparing neuronal pathways between humans and model organisms (Mice, Rats) can have numerous benefits for scientists studying neuroscience and related fields.

Here are some of the key advantages:

- gain valuable insights into the similarities and differences in brain organization and connectivity across species.
- understand how findings from mouse/rat studies may translate to human brain function and behavior.
- help validate the accuracy of these models and ensure that the neural circuits under investigation are relevant to the human condition.
